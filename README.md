# Restaurant Reviews App

## Description

The Restaurants Reviews App is a demonstration of mobile-and-offline first web development practices, built as part of a training course with Google and Udacity. The homepage of the app provides a filterable list of restaurants in the New York area. The details pages of each restaurant provides a description and reviews of that restaurant.

## Installation

To get the code for this project up and running to test it out, follow these steps:

* First, make sure you have all of the project's dependencies installed. Development on this codebase requires Node.js, a global installation of the Grunt CLI (installed AFTER you install Node.js), and GraphicsMagick, and Python 3.
* Once you have all the dependencies installed, fork and clone this repository onto your local machine.
* In a command line terminal, from the main project directory, run `npm install`.
* Then, in the same terminal, run `python3 -m http.server 8000` to start the server. You can now open a browser and test the app by navigating to `http://localhost:8080`, but you'll notice that the app isnt quite working yet. That's because there are just a few more steps.
* You'll also need another repo, which is an API that provides the data that this app uses. Go ahead and clone this repo too, in a separate folder.
* Follow all of the instructions in this OTHER repo's `readme` file to get its server up and running, then go visit `http://localhost:8080` in your browser. Everything should be good to go!
